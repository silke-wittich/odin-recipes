        <h2>An easy to follow recipe for a tasty, 9-inch chicken pot pie.</h2>
        <p>The best classic homemade chicken pot pie with a flaky crust and creamy chicken pot pie filling.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons unstalted butter</li>
            <li>1 lb. boneless skinnless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced celery</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>2 (1 top and 1 bottom) unbaked pie crusts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure there is an oven rack on the bottom rack of the oven. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
            <li> Add the butter to a large skillet over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, add the
                chicken, carrots, celery, onion, salt, garlic powder, thyme leaves, and pepper. Cook for 8-10
                minutes, until the chicken is cooked through, stirring often.</li>
            <li>Add the flour. Stir well, until no dry flour remains. Slowly stir in the cream, then the chicken
                broth. Cook until bubbling and thick, stirring often, 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat. Stir in the peas and flat leaf parsley. Let this cool for 15-30 minutes
                before filling the pie*.</li>
            <li>Fit one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate. Spoon the cooled filling into the pie crust. Top with
                the second pie crust. Seal the edges of the pie crust together. Cut 3-4 slits in the top crust to
                allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li> Place the filled pie plate on a baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes on the bottom rack of the
                oven.</li>
            <li>Cool for 15-30 minutes before slicing and serving.**</li>
        </ol>
        <p>*Pouring hot filling into the unbaked pie crust will make the crust soggy. You could make the filling
            up to 3 days ahead of time and store it in a sealed container in the refrigerator.
            <br>**The longer the pot pie can cool before slicing, the thicker/less runny the filling will be.</p>
